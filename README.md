🏡 House Price Prediction

📌 Overview

This project aims to predict house prices using machine learning models. The dataset contains various features influencing house prices, such as location, number of bedrooms, square footage, and other relevant parameters. The project is implemented using Python in a Jupyter Notebook.

📊 Dataset

The dataset used for this project is stored in HousePricePrediction.xlsx. It includes various attributes affecting house prices. The data undergoes preprocessing, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) before being used for training models.

📁 Project Structure

📂 Files in this repository:

📜 house.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

📄 HousePricePrediction.xlsx → The dataset used for training and testing the models.

🔑 Features

The dataset includes the following features:
✔ Number of bedrooms 🛏️
✔ Number of bathrooms 🚿
✔ Square footage 📏
✔ Location 📍
✔ Year built 🏗️
✔ Other relevant housing attributes 🏠

⚙ Installation

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

🚀 Usage

1️⃣ Open house.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
2️⃣ Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate predictions.
3️⃣ Modify parameters as needed to fine-tune the models.

📈 Model Performance

The notebook evaluates different machine learning models, including:

🤖 Linear Regression

🌳 Decision Trees

🌲 Random Forest

📊 Other regression models

📏 Performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and R² are used to assess the accuracy of predictions.

🏆 Results

The best-performing model is selected based on evaluation metrics. The final model is used to predict house prices on unseen data.
